# Accessing-Web-Data

Web scrapping is very dear to programmers and data scientists becuase by this they can gether a lot of data for their evaluation.
This repository will go through accessing data from the web. This repository doesnot contains pro level guide of how to access 
any data but it contains few examples of accessing data like links and numbers and all text data etc.

Libraries used are:
   1. socket
   2. urllib
   3. BeautifulSoup
   4. ssl
 
 ssl is not used for scrapping data but it is for avoiding ssl certificate issues.
